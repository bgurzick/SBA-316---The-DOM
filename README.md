SBA 316 - The DOM
Objectives
Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

My idea was to have a form that made real-time changes on the website.  In this way, my project was practical, kind of like a build-your-own-website, but mine is somewhat rudimentary and featureless.

By making different kinds of form elements (text, radio buttons, check box), I was able to use different DOM/BOM techniques like the 'keyup' and 'on change', and form validation techniques that we learned about in class.

As usual, I wish I had more time. I added a button to meet the 'append' requirement, but I didn't have enough time to make it a practical or useful button.  I borrowed some of the styling from our in-class activity, which helped to save me some time in the process.  I think this is probably a realistic part of the process, because programmers are frequently borrowing from new trends, high-traffic sites, and just generally googling things.

With more time, I would simply make it more robust and maybe more visually appealing (greater consideration to the color schemes). Instead, I just wanted to be sure that the background color changes were obvious.

Oh! I also want more time to (perhaps obviously) make the registration form disappear once it has been successfully completed.
